Minecraft Remote Controller
===========================

This is a super simple client application that can be used to communicate with a remote Minecraft server as long as Rcon protocol is enabled. Originally it was part of the [rconsharp](https://github.com/stefanodriussi/rconsharp), developed with the purpose of showing how to use the library but on a second thought, it just doesn't belong there, so now it has his own repository.
